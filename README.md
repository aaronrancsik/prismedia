## Installation

You may use pip to install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
(*note:* requirements are generated via `poetry export -f requirements.txt`)

Otherwise, you can use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org):

```
poetry install # installs the dependency in the current virtualenv, 
or creates one specific to the project if no virtualenv is currently active
```


## Configuration

Generate sample files with `python -m prismedia.genconfig`.  
Then edit `peertube_secret` and `youtube_secret.json` with your credentials. (see below)

### Peertube
Set your credentials, peertube server URL.  
You can get client_id and client_secret by logging in your peertube website and reaching the URL:  
https://domain.example/api/v1/oauth-clients/local  
You can set ``OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT`` to 1 if you do not use https (not recommended)

### Youtube
Youtube uses combination of oauth and API access to identify.

**Credentials**
The first time you connect, prismedia will open your browser to as you to authenticate to
Youtube and allow the app to use your Youtube channel.  
**It is here you choose which channel you will upload to**.  
Once authenticated, the token is stored inside the file ``.youtube_credentials.json``.  
Prismedia will try to use this file at each launch, and re-ask for authentication if it does not exist.

**Oauth**:  
The default youtube_secret.json should allow you to upload some videos.  
If you plan an larger usage, please consider creating your own youtube_secret file:

 - Go to the [Google console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
 - Create project.
 - Side menu: APIs & auth -> APIs
 - Top menu: Enabled API(s): Enable all Youtube APIs.
 - Side menu: APIs & auth -> Credentials.
 - Create a Client ID: Add credentials -> OAuth 2.0 Client ID -> Other -> Name: prismedia1 -> Create -> OK
 - Download JSON: Under the section "OAuth 2.0 client IDs". Save the file to your local system.
 - Save this JSON as your youtube_secret.json file.

## Usage
Support only mp4 for cross compatibility between Youtube and Peertube

Upload a video:

```
python -m prismedia --file="yourvideo.mp4"
```

Specify description and tags:

```
python -m prismedia --file="yourvideo.mp4" -d "My supa description" -t "tag1,tag2,foo"
```

Provide a thumbnail:

```
python -m prismedia --file="yourvideo.mp4" -d "Video with thumbnail" --thumbnail="/path/to/your/thumbnail.jpg"
```


Use a NFO file to specify your video options:  
(See nfo_example.txt for more precise example)
```
python -m prismedia --file="yourvideo.mp4" --nfo /path/to/your/nfo.txt
```


Use --help to get all available options:

```

## Enhanced use of NFO
Since Prismedia v0.9.0, the NFO system has been improved to allow hierarchical loading.
First of all, **if you already used nfo**, either with `--nfo` or by using `videoname.txt`, nothing changes :-)

But you are now able to use a more flexible NFO system, by using priorities. This allow you to set some defaults to avoid recreating a full nfo for each video

Basically, Prismedia will now load options in this order, using the last value found in case of conflict:  
`nfo.txt < directory_name.txt < video_name.txt < command line NFO < command line argument`

You'll find a complete set of samples in the [prismedia/samples](prismedia/samples) directory so let's take it as an example:
```
$ tree Recipes/
Recipes/
â”œâ”€â”€ cli_nfo.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ nfo.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ samples.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ yourvideo1.mp4
â”œâ”€â”€ yourvideo1.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ yourvideo1.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ yourvideo2.mp4
â””â”€â”€ yourvideo2.txt
```

By using 
```
prismedia --file=/path/to/Recipes/yourvideo1.mp4 --nfo=/path/to/Recipes/cli_nfo.txt --cca
```

Prismedia will:
- look for options in `nfo.txt`
- look for options in `samples.txt` (from directory name) and erase any previous conflicting options
- look for options in `yourvideo1.txt` (from video name) and erase any previous conflicting options
- look for options in `cli_nfo.txt` (from the `--nfo` in command line) and erase any previous conflicting options
- erase any previous option regarding CCA as it's specified in cli with `--cca`
- take `yourvideo1.jpg` as thumbnail if no other files has been specified in previous NFO

In other word, Prismedia will now use option given in cli, then look for option in cli_nfo.txt, then complete with video_name.txt, then directory_name.txt, and finally complete with nfo.txt

It allows to specify more easily default options for an entire set of video, directory, playlist and so on.
